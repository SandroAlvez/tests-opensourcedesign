# Open Source Contribution: Automated tests for the Open Source Design project
This is a project to practice Test Automation with Cypress (JavaScript), and to contribute to the open source project Open Source Design.

## How I'm doing it

Stacks: JavaScript, Cypress, Git

  To build this contribution project I am using Cypress, it is a framework built in JavaScript for automating web application tests.

Documentation: Google Sheets.

  Since I'm aiming for a practical easy-to-read documentation, I chose to use Google Sheets. It's easy to organize and visualize tests, and it's also simple to share.

  I am developing the documentation as I go along the pages/features. To summarize, here is the structure of the documentation:

  - Project: A quick view of the product being tested: the product objective, useful links, and the features that will be tested (which I am updating as I identify and test them).
  - Introduction: Information on the test plan (its purpose, target audience, scope and references).
  - Test Strategy: Which types of tests will be used in the given Test Pyramid parts.
  - Acceptance Criteria: Based on the objectives of the product I wrote some ACs to drive the tests.
  - Scope: Here is where the test scenarios are registered. I link them to the AC they're covering and the test case IDs that were used.
  - Test Cases: To document the tests I'm using.
  - Bugs: Where I register the defects found in the website and their criticality. The evidences are stored in a different folder, and I share the link to it.

## Value Created

I noticed that the Open Source Design community didn't have any automation to test their website. So it would take a couple of hours to test all of their internal and external links, forms, authentications, blog functions, page performance, among other functionalities.

This project aims to make it possible for the community to test the website in a few minutes.
