# Open Source Contribution: Automated tests for the Open Source Design project
This is a project to practice Test Automation with Cypress (JavaScript), and to contribute to the open source project Open Source Design.

Link to the project: https://github.com/opensourcedesign/

## How it's made

Stacks: JavaScript, Cypress, Git

To build this contribution project I am using Cypress, it is a framework built in JavaScript for automating web application tests. 

## Value Created

I noticed that the Open Source Design community didn't have any automation to test their website. So it would take a couple of hours to test all of their internal and external links, forms, authentications, blog functions, page performance, among other functionalities.

This project aims to make it possible for the community to test the website in a few minutes.
